   - A section explaining the purchase process and payment options.
   - A contact form for users to reach you with inquiries.

   - A table listing the album title, artist name, album art, price, and a "Buy Now" button for each album.
   - Sorting and filtering options to help users find albums easily.

   - A summary of the selected album, its price, and the total amount payable.
   - Fields for entering payment information, including name, card number, expiration date, and CVV.
   - A "Confirm Purchase" button to initiate the payment process.

## Routes
---
1. `/`: This route maps to the `index()` view function in your Flask application. It serves the `index.html` page.

2. `/music_catalog`: This route maps to the `music_catalog()` view function, which retrieves the list of available music albums from a database or alternative data source and renders the `music_catalog.html` page.

3. `/buy_now/<album_id>`: This route takes the album's unique ID as a parameter and is mapped to the `buy_now()` view function. It displays the selected album's details, payment options, and a form to initiate the purchase. The view function then renders the `checkout.html` page.

4. `/process_purchase`: This route, mapped to the `process_purchase()` view function, handles the payment process. It validates the provided payment information, initiates the payment transaction, and saves the transaction details in a database or suitable data storage. Upon successful payment, it redirects the user to the confirmation page (`confirmation.html`).

5. `/download_music/<album_id>`: This route takes the album's unique ID as a parameter and maps to the `download_music()` view function. It generates a download link for the purchased album and renders the confirmation page.

These HTML files and routes form the core components of your Flask application, enabling users to browse music albums, make purchases, and download purchased music.
